# My portfolio
Source for my portfolio website.

This page is hosted from GitHub pages: https://benshanahan1.github.io

## Install
Current requires:
```bash
$ npm --version
7.5.1
$ node --version
v15.8.0
```

Clone the repository and run:
```bash
npm install
```

## Develop
To run a development server and open the hot-reloadable page in the browser:
```bash
npm start
```

## Build
To create a **local** production build:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Deploy
To deploy the site to GitHub pages:
```bash
npm run deploy
```

If the site no longer shows up at the custom domain, you might need to go into the repo settings and update the custom domain. For some reason, deploying to GitHub pages seems to reset this field every time.
